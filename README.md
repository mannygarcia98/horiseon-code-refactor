# Horiseon Code Refactor

![Horiseon Screenshot](./assets/images/Horiseonscreenshot.png)

Horiseon has asked me to improve the accessibility of their site. This was accomplished by adding alt attributes to all images.

I also made sure all links work, changed divs to semantic html tags, and added comments for easier maintenance of the site.

The site is available for review [here.](https://mannygarcia98.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/)
